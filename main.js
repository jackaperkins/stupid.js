//hello


Here is a piece of source code from the Go programming language. It is not javascript. This text is not javascript. Maybe you could make it a string or put it in a function

	BestSpeed          = flate.BestSpeed

That is the end of the Go license. There's nothing below here. Maybe there could be. I do not know such things.

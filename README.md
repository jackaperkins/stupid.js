# What is stupid.js?

Stupid.js is a useless library. Stupid.js is a chain letter. It's the Facebook wall. Stupid.js is a collaborative project in creating useless code. Add whatever you want to stupid.js. Add some buffer overflows, add some Python, add an operating system, a picture of your favorite salamander, I don't care. Just put some stupid junk in there for no reason, because we're sharing, and because you CAN. Just keep it SFW please.

# What *isn't* stupid.js?

Stupid.js is not code that you should execute, ever. The best and most likely scenario is that it will do nothing at all. The worst case is that it could irrevocably damage your computer or other computers. Treat everything in stupid.js as if it's a plain text file, even if it's an executable or a .c or whatever it is.

# Why is stupid.js?

Because everything is stupid. Why not partake in something that's at least stupid *on purpose*?

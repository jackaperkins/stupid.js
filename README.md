# What is stupid.js?

Stupid.js is a useless library. Stupid.js is a chain letter. It's the Facebook wall. Stupid.js is a collaborative project in creating useless code. Add whatever you want to stupid.js. Add some buffer overflows, add some Python, add an operating system, a picture of your favorite salamander, I don't care. You can also add valid, useful JavaScript or other code, but there's going to be a lot of other stuff around it that will likely render it inoperable. But that doesn't matter! Stupid.js is *theoretical* code. A thought experiment. Public graffiti. Just put something in there for no reason, because we're sharing, and because you CAN. Just keep it SFW please.

# What *isn't* stupid.js?

Stupid.js is not code that you should execute, ever. The best and most likely scenario is that it will do nothing at all. The worst case is that it could irrevocably damage your computer or other computers. Treat everything in stupid.js as if it's a plain text file, even if it's an executable or a .c or whatever it is.

# Why is stupid.js?

Because everything is stupid. Why not partake in something that's at least stupid *on purpose*? There is also no barrier to entry beyond having a github account and vaguely knowing how it works. If you don't know how it works but want to contribute anyway, ask a friend! Maybe your two-year-old neice wants to add something. Maybe your monitor lizard has some valuable insight on singletons she wants to show the world. Just go for it.
